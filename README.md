## ðŸ”‘ Steps to make it run



1. You need PHP in your system 

- Be aware that fresh installation of PHP on windows OS needs to set the `php.ini` file since it comes with php.ini-development and php.ini-production. And create the environment variable path to the php installation folder.

- Also inside `php.ini` you need to make sure that `mysqli` and `mbstring` extensions are not commented with the semicolon `;` .

_You can check if both extensions are running using_  `php -m`  _or setting the_  `info.php`  _page to display the info about the running PHP package._

2. Set the variable data in `.env` file as shown in `.env.example` to make it work against a MySQL instance and make the google maps API work.

3. Make sure the MySQL instance is up and running.

4. Start the built-in local web server

```javascript
 $ php -S localhost:8000 // you can choose whichever free port you have
```
_As side note, this app works with the [EFTEC\BladeOne](https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne) repo (BladeOne outside of Laravel) and the [vlucas\phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) repo, both installed manually inside the libs folder. (You could install both via composer for easier installation/manteinence)._
